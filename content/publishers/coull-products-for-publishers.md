Coull offer publishers a marketplace for selling linear and non-linear video inventory to reputable brands and their agencies. The Coull Marketplace provides the following integration options:

##### Tags
Connect to Coull with URL tags that are easy to integrate and require no developer resources. Coull VAST ad tags support in-stream and OverStream video ads for desktop and mobile web. You may also activate the Coull DoubleUp advertising feature for this integration type, for more information contact your Coull publisher account manager, or, [support@coull.com](mailto:support@coull.com).


Coull VAST ad tags are supported in VAST-compliant video players and are compatible with all major ad servers.

To see details about inventory types available from your tag integration and video players currently supported, check out our [integration guidance](/publishers/integration-guidance/).

##### Coull plugin

Coullâ€™s plugin is ideal for publishers who want to simplify their integration and to take advantage of additional Coull formats such as OnPause. As well as creating additional video inventory from your existing video supply, it enables unique ad format combinations to be delivered on your video player for higher sales premiums.

To see if your video player is already supported, see [integration guidance](/publishers/integration-guidance/).
