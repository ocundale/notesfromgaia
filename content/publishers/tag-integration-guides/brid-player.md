1. ​Once you have logged into your account, select the site and the player you wish to monetise.
You can also monetise your default player or other by clicking on the *players* tab at the
top of the screen.

2. ​Once you’re on the player setting page, navigate to the monetisation section and ensure that
you have the *Monetizable* box checked, otherwise you’ll not be able to display ads.

3. ​In the *Advanced Options* section, select **Overlay** and add the QUASAR tag, as provided by
your Coull account manager. Add this tag to the top URL field.
Here, you can also set the start and duration times of the OverStream ad.

4. ​Now save.

If you have any issues with setting up, then please don’t hesitate to get in contact.
