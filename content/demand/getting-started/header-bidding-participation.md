If there is an adapter available for the Prebid.js header bidding wrapper to connect to your business for bids, you can be included in header bidding auctions on our traffic. The list of available adapters can be found in the official <a href="http://prebid.org/dev-docs/bidders.html#bidders" target="_blank">Prebid Documentation</a>.

We are also able to discuss a more customised integration if you prefer to provide your own header bidding product or believe there could be scope to monetise traffic another way.
