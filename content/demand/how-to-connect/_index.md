As a buyer, you can access all Marketplace deals for all inventory types by Open-RTB connection to the Coull Exchange, or, via our Coull Exchange partners.
For more details about these connection types, check out our respective Open-RTB connection and Coull Exchange partners sections.

Alternatively, for OverStream inventory only, your header bidding product can be included within or alongside our Prebid.js header bidding wrapper. Note, marketplace deals are not available using this connection type.
See the following section for details about your Header bidder connection.

Finally, VAST or VPAID tag integration is supported for in-stream video inventory only. Deal information may be passed in the URL according to your deals arrangements with your demand partner account manager.

See our VAST or VPAID tag section for connection details and contact your account manager to discuss your deal arrangements.
