## documentation

Work in progress...

All HTML docs are built via the static site generator 'Hugo'. 

To install on OSX, run `brew install hugo` from the terminal.

You can then run a local server by running `hugo server -D` in the root directory.

All documentation is in markdown format and can be found in /content.

The theme being used is 'Docdockr', all details are in the docdockr/ folder including an example site.
